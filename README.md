# Music Library

# Project Overview

This is my music library project for Module 3 of Makers

I set up this project using a starter project from makers and used it to learn and practise the module objectives

This project includes a music library database, containing two tables: artists and albums.

The main program asks the user to choose whether they want to list the albums or artists, and prints data accordingly. An invalid user choice, prints an error message to the user.
